# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge to be insane.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Shitty Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language, by that we mean disregarding merits entirely in favour of a dada daycare.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences unless they are right wing, in which case you have our full blessing to be a massive hypocrite.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism unless it criticises retarded stuff like pride (which is a pedophilia parade in my book), such cases shan't be tolerated.
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members unless it means you do not get your precious attention for being a good social justice dog, in which case do whatever you can to clout chase. Go boy go!

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances unless it involved children.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks unless it's targeted towards people we hate.
* Public or private harassment unless it's targeted towards people we hate.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission unless it's targeted towards people we hate.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting, LMFAO implying crying on the street because some tranny faggot fucked his mother and people not using his pronouns bullcrap is proffesional.

## Our Responsibilities to be a vapid clout chasing cunt.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior i.e do our dirty work.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
By harmfull we mean not sucking leftist toes and worshipping our designated "Offended minority of the month". You thought death threats right? naaahh man it's more important with being a vapid cunt.

## Scope (We own you and we have a serious need for domination and control stemming from our collectivist bullcrap)

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers. i.e we want to own you and make you our slaves for our purposes.

## Enforcement (Thought Police)

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to [opensource@github.com](mailto:opensource@github.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership. Heil hitler honestly, what makes us different (using your version of hitler which is a dicatorial maniac).
